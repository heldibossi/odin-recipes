        <h2>Eggs Benedict:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>8 eggs</li>
            <li>strips Canadian-style bacon</li>
            <li>4 English muffins, split</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the Hollandaise: Whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of water, Worcestershire sauce and white pepper in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Add melted butter,
                1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, while whisking until all of the butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on the pan to keep sauce warm.
            </li>
            <li>To poach the eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar and keep water at a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into
                a small bowl then gently slip egg into simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of the water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs untiul whites are firm and yolks have
                thickened but are not hard, 2 and a half to 3 minutes. Remove eggs from the water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water and place onto a warm plate.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the ovne's broiler. Brown bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Toast english muffins on a backing sheet
                under the preheated broiler.
            </li>
            <li>To serve Eggs Benedict: Spreat toasted muffins with a softened butter and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise
                sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
