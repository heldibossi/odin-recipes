        <p>The secret to really great brownie is using both melted chocolate <b>and</b> cocoa powder, plus butter instead of oil (because butter has way better flavour than oil). The combination of these
        plus minimal flour, just enough to make a barely-set batter, and brown sugar rather than white (for extra moisture and chewiness) is what will deliever that perfect rich, fudgy brownie you've been
        dreaming about</p>
        <p>These dreamy brownies start by melting chocolate and butter together before whisking in eggs and vanilla. Then just mix in flour and coco powder and lastly stir in the let's-pretend-it's-optional chocolate chunks.
        Scrape into lined pan and bake!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g / 14 tbsp unsalted butter (1 3/4 US sticks)</li>
            <li>200g / 1 1/4 cups dark chocolate chips (7oz)</li>
            <li>1 cup (175g) brown sugar, loosely packed</li>
            <li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (75g) plain flour</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>180g / 6oz dark chocolate block/bar (optional), chopped into chunks rather than shards (bittersweet or semi-sweet, cooking chocolate)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan forced).</li>
            <li>Spray a 20cm/8" square tin with oil and line with baking/parchment paper with overhang</li>
            <li>Place butter and chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl, microwave in 30 second bursts (takes around 1m 30sec) until melted. Stir until smooth</li>
            <li>Add sugar and vanilla, mix, then add eggs and mix well until smooth and molten.</li>
            <li>Add flour, cocoa, salt and stir until smooth. Stir in chopped chocolate, pour into pan.</li>
            <li>Bake 24 minutes for really gooey in the centre, 28 minutes for fudgey but still very moist, 32 minutes for moist fudge-cake-like.</li>
            <li>If you didn't use the extra chocolate for stirring in, reduce cook time by 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest for 10 minutes before lifting out of the pan. Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Enjoy</h3>
