        <p>To be able to bake the chewiest. tastiest Chocolate Chip Cookies there are some <u>crucial</u> steps that need to be followed.
        First, skip using chips and opt for chunks. Second, instead of using just one type of chocolate (like semisweet), use a mix of the latter, milk and dark chocolate.
        Third, take the nessecary time to allow the cookie dough to rest overnight in the refrigirator. Doing so will yield the cookie a more complex flavour and delicious toffee notes.
        And lastly, have an icecream scoop to portion the cookie onto the baking sheet, to make even sized cookies. Follow the instructions below and you'll be rewarded with the most delicious
        chocolate chip cookies.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 grams)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar (165 grams), packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (155 grams)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>110 grams milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>110 grams dark chocolate chunk, or your preference</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla extract, beating until light ribbons fall of the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula.
                <ul>
                    <li>Be careful not to overmix, as this would toughen the gluten in the flour, resulting in cakier cookies.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fold the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for atleast 30 minutes.
                <ul>
                    <li>For a more intense toffee-like flavour and deeper colour, chill the dough overnight.</li>
                    <li>The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavour will be.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an icecream scoop onto the parchment-lined paper.
                <ul>
                    <li>Leave at least 4 inches/ 10 centimeter of space between cookies and 2 inches/ 5 centimeter from the edges to allow even spreading.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
        </ol>
